In this project, I will train a model that can decode sequences of digits from natural images, and create an app that prints the numbers it sees in real time. 

### Setup
Recommended setup for a simple Python script or web app/service:

Python
NumPy, SciPy, iPython
TensorFlowâ„¢

### Data
Street View House Numbers (SVHN): A large-scale dataset of house numbers in Google Street View images.
